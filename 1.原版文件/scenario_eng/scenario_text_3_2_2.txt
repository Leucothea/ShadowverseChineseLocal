"Text_01","Oof!"
"Text_02","You're not going to get in my way."
"Text_03","I can see just how far you are prepared to go..."
"Text_04","The depth of your love, your sadness. I'm sorry, I had to be sure."
"Text_05","What are you trying to say?"
"Text_06","There are those whose despair swallows them, and those whose despair powers them."
"Text_07","You are the latter."
"Text_08","There are rumors of a girl who lives in the forest southeast of here. They say she can speak with the dead."
"Text_09","With the dead?"
"Text_10","I cannot attest to the rumors' truth..."
"Text_11","There, however, is a chance that the girl has some unknown power."
"Text_12","A chance..."
"Text_13","It may seem farfetched. But the girl inspires fear in all those she meets."
"Text_14","I'll keep that in mind."
"Text_15","I apologize for being so aggressive."
"Text_16","Not at all. I too had to be certain... Please forgive me."
"Text_17","Sure."
"Text_18","I hope I have been of some assistance."
