"Text_06","Do not worry, the girl was able to escape unharmed."
"Text_07","That's a relief. You are?"
"Text_08","I am Eris. It would seem that you have been afflicted by a dying dragon's curse."
"Text_09","(She's been watching me.)"
"Text_10","A curse..."
"Text_11","A curse that transforms you into a bloodthirsty dragon whenever your desire to protect overwhelms you."
"Text_12","So I'm a murderer..."
"Text_13","It need not be so. Make your way to the Morning Star."
"Text_14","I don't see how that would change anything."
"Text_15","It is up to you whether you heed my word. My only wish is to ease the suffering of others."
"Text_16","(There's no going home like this. It could be my last best option.) "

"Text_21","May your despair become your liberation."
