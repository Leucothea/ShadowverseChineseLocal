"Text_01","Your strength is obvious..."
"Text_02","Silence!"
"Text_03","But if you do not know what is truly at stake, you will surely fail again."
"Text_04","Either you destroy Urias, or the princess must be sacrificed to banish him once more."
"Text_05","Not another word."
"Text_06","Move with haste."
"Text_07","Has she run back to Urias?"
"Text_08","(Her lies about the princess were meant to frighten me...)"
"Text_09","The castle is in trouble. I have to get back..."
"Text_10","Princess!"
"Text_11","Erika! You're back safe!"
"Text_12","What happened to you?"
"Text_13","Princess, you're okay."
"Text_14","You're crying..."
"Text_15","It's just something in my eye."
"Text_16","It's fine, Erika. Everything's okay."
"Text_17","It can't have been easy. I'll have to inform my brother that Urias has awakened."
"Text_18","I'm sorry..."
"Text_19","Most would have fared far worse against an opponent like Urias."
"Text_20","I apologize for sending you on such a dangerous mission."
"Text_21","(Could he have been holding back?)"
"Text_22","If it's Balthazar that he's looking for, Urias might be heading for the royal mausoleum."
"Text_23","That's a strong possibility."
"Text_24","In that case, he's likely already defeated our guards."
"Text_25","We have to act now."
"Text_26","(Ask now and clear your mind, Erika.)"
"Text_27","Before I leave, I'd be grateful for your opinion about something."
"Text_28","Why might someone say Urias could only be banished in exchange for the life of a princess?"
"Text_29","..."
"Text_30","Why?"
"Text_31","Because it's true."
"Text_32","No! It can't be!"
