"Text_01","Urghhh!"
"Text_02","I told you. I am far stronger than you realize."
"Text_03","Oof!"
"Text_04","What do you want from me?"
"Text_05","I need to bring someone back to life."
"Text_06","You're proof that it's possible. I think it may have to do with your blood."
"Text_07","You have to let me investigate!"
"Text_08","You are delusional."
"Text_09","Death can no more be reversed than the hours of the day."
"Text_10","Vampires' lives may be longer than those of humans."
"Text_11","But they end all the same."
"Text_12","You're lying. There has to be some clue in your blood!"
"Text_13","My blood is my own."
"Text_14","It is unrelated to my awakening."
"Text_15","For that I must thank some force beyond my ken."
"Text_16","Death is eternal. Had I died, I would not be before you now."
"Text_17","I'm not going to give up just like that!"

"Text_20","Farewell."
"Text_21","(If death were reversible...)"
"Text_22","(I would have you return, Balthazar, to fight again.)"
"Text_23","(This time I would triumph.)"
