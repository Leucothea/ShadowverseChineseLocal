"Text_02","Phew. Are you all okay?"
"Text_03","Ah, thanks for the help. I'm still not sure we can trust you though."
"Text_04","Your doubt is justified, for my sins are indeed weighty."
"Text_05","I'll trust you, Eris! I will. I don't think you're lying, and I can't rescue Losaria by myself anyway."
"Text_06","She does have a point. We're in no position to quibble over our methods."
"Text_07","I agree. But I can't say I feel like cooperating with everyone here."
"Text_08","You need not worry, for I intend to make my own way."
"Text_09","When we're through with Nexus, I will see that your life ends, Urias. Mark my words."
"Text_10","Ha-ha, well enough. May we battle then!"
"Text_11","The rest of you will fight at my side, will you not? I thank you dearly and offer my wholehearted gratitude."
"Text_12","Huh? Gratitude! No, I just want to save Losaria. I'll do whatever it takes."
"Text_13","I can't let my family be extinguished. Count me in."
"Text_14","I don't want to disappoint Kyle. I'm going to help."
"Text_15","I am the princess's sword and her shield. For her I will do everything within my power."
"Text_16","What about you, Luna? What would you like to do?"
"Text_17","I dunno."
"Text_18","Luna, you should come with us. You could get hurt if you're all alone."
"Text_19","Okay."
"Text_20","Let us proceed nowâ€”the hour is at hand. We must liberate the world from Nexus."
