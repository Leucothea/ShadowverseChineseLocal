"Text_01","Am I out yet?"
"Text_02","Phew..."
"Text_03","Hey! It's you, isn't it, Erika?"
"Text_04","Oh, you're the... What brought you here?"
"Text_05","I think I was dreaming inside the Morning Star. Ah-ha-ha! But that doesn't make any sense, does it?"
"Text_06","
No, it does. The same thing most likely happened to me.
"
"Text_07","Huh! Are you serious?"
"Text_08","I am.
Hm?
Arisa, stand back!"
"Text_09","Where am I?"
"Text_10","Did I make it back?"
"Text_11","Hm. It seems we weren't the only ones trapped in that dreamland."
"Text_12","
Erika, it's the mist again!"
"Text_13","..."
"Text_14","That makes five of us. No, wait, there's another! Is that—no, it couldn't be!"
"Text_15","Oh, what good fortune! So many opponents in one location."
"Text_16","Urias Formonde! You were in the dreamland too?"
"Text_17","Ha-ha-ha! Yes, that wearisome dream! Now, before I pay a visit to her, you must entertain me."
"Text_18","Please stop. We must not fight one another."
"Text_19","Eris!
You are Eris, right?"
"Text_20","Yes. I am Eris Anthule, but I am not the one you know."
"Text_21","The Eris before you no longer wishes to liberate the world by extinguishing it."
"Text_22","Then what are you trying to do?"
"Text_23","I must destroy the almigh—must destroy Nexus. Even if it costs me my life."
"Text_24","But was it not you who summoned her?"
"Text_25","It was. I was prideful, and my pride led me to commit grave errors. But all the same, I must ask for your help."
"Text_26","Not even in a dream could I defeat Nexus alone. So I beg of you. Please fight at my side."
"Text_27","You're asking us to trust you?"
"Text_28","It may be a brazen request, but I need your power."
"Text_29","[ROAR]"
"Text_30","On the path to Nexus, we will encounter a thousand—no, thousands of these creatures. Please stand back, everyone!"
